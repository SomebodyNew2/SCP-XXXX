Currently contained asÂ [SCP-3477-3](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3477). Joined 05 council as of 1967 and had a ploy to gain access to #SCP-006 in an attempt to achieve "immortality", this attempt was successful until the sudden appearance of several individuals alike to him claiming to be "Harold Holt" (This is the Australian Prime Minister that disappeared) they were stripped of all authority and given an SCP designation and was contained for 46 years. Not likely deceased, this could just mean that he escaped, or was set free, by something or someone.
