1. The world resets on a loop, but the SCP itself is the mechanism of the loop. When the Scarlet King nears full descent (often triggered by the SCP weakening due to Foundation interference), or when humanity is fully eradicated (making the SCP too strong but rendering its purpose moot), the SCP, in a final act of self-preservation and cosmic balance, resets the timeline. This allows it to try again, subtly influencing events in each loop, perhaps trying to nudge humanity towards a different, more sustainable, equilibriumâ€”or perhaps it's a cosmic AI, endlessly running simulations to find the "perfect" balance where it can exist powerfully enough to contain the King, yet not so powerfully that it eradicates its own purpose (humanity). The psychotic breaks could be researchers retaining faint, fragmented memories of past loops, hinting at the cyclical nightmare they're trapped in. The question becomes: Is the loop a prison, or humanity's only salvation? And if so, how many times has this happened before?
