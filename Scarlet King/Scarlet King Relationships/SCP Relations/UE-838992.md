A circle of nine statues surrounding a one thousand years old altar dedicated to [Azura](https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Azura_\(Elder_Scrolls\) "w:c:hero:Azura (Elder Scrolls)"). It was built by denizens of either [Daleport](https://scp-db.fandom.com/wiki/Daleport "w:c:scp-db:Daleport") or Hedaphis in gratitude to their goddess for helping fight the Scarlet King and his army, while the statues were people who were petrified for their unforgivable crimes.
