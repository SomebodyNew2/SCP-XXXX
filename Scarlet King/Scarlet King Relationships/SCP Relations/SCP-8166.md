A music box formerly belonging to magician Hans Christian Andersen which opens a portal to SCP-8166-1, a pocket dimension resembling a vast garden. The garden was inhabited by various creatures designated SCP-8166-2, and guarded an angelic figure, SCP-8166-3. Among those who lived in it were a deer woman named Reverie who was the latest in a line of nymphs, SCP-8166-4, and spirit woman known as Kindred who raised Reverie, SCP-8166-5. Clef and Luca Armaro entered the garden, befriending Reverie and Kindred, but their interaction caused Reverie to question the reality she grew in and be overtaken by corruption, becoming a power hungry empress. Clef killed her, resulting in the creation of a new deer girl Meri who was designated SCP-8166-2. Unfortunately, just like her predecessors, Meri would also slowly become corrupted by her insecurity which manifested as a crimson shadow of herself.
