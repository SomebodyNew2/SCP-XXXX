Collective designation for a concentration of thaumaturgical residue created as a result of the anomalous rituals conducted by both The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo in their war against each other. Some of the rituals were done by [[the Children]] to improve The Coca-Cola Company's products as part of their agreement in the late 90s, but as a result of this various phenomena occurred such as the company's machinery bleeding, a howling being heard in their plant, seven of their employees going missing and the disappearance of several PepsiCo bottling plants along with 30,000 employees.
