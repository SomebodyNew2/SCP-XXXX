A small chapel-like structure located in the Lazarists Monastery's garden in the Stavroupoli region of Thessaloniki, Greece, housing a stone well, designated SCP-6626-1, that leads to a puddle of regenerating water, and a ladder, designated SCP-6626-2, that is suspended in the air and leads to up to a pocket dimension, designated SCP-6626-3. When someone goes up the ladder and into the pocket dimension, they'll disappear along with some amount of water from the well, and after that ghostly entities resembling the person would manifest and convince nearby people to climb the ladder, claiming that the pocket dimension was heaven. However, it was later revealed that the chapel's builder Father Leonardo Sicarie, had unbeknownst to him been manipulated by the Scarlet King during the construction, and those who went up the ladder were sacrificed to the god.
