A prototype Boeing airplane resembling Boeing 737 which was constructed by a unknown man influenced by an outside force. Its emergency door, designated SCP-616-1, would open every 30 days and reveal a portal to hellish dimension which would attempt to take the lives of everyone surrounding the plane as the door closed back, causing the corpses left to chant in a unknown language. To keep it from harming people, the plane is to fly at a distance where it couldn't affect the populace while preachers with strong faith were to pray to slow down the door's closing, else a destructive event would ensue. It was revealed that this plane was created by premillennialist [[David Nicholson]] as a way for him and a few of his selected followers to ascend to Heaven and be reincarnated during the Rapture, but it instead would open a portal for the [[Scarlet King's Army]] to enter Earth's space and spread destruction.
