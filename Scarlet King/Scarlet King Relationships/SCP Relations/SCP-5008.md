A massive machine created by the ancient [Mekhanites](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_the_Broken_God "Church of the Broken God") which was gifted to the [[Erikeshans]] (https://scp-db.fandom.com/wiki/Erikeshans "w:c:scp-db:Erikeshans"). This engine served to make certain ideas and concepts unthinkable by the affected individuals, such as keeping the [[Scarlet King]] worship from spreading. [[The Children]] possess several sections of the Erikesh Codex which was needed to operate the machine, but it didn't prevent the [[SCP Foundation]] from using it for their purposes.
