A group of seven young human females who were kidnapped by the Children and became pregnant with the Scarlet Spawn as a result of a ritual conducted on them. Each of them would give birth to monstrosities while causing disasters somewhere around the world, with the last birth possibly destroying the world. After being taken by the Foundation, the organization was forced to execute a horrible torture designated Procedure 110-Montauk which disgusted even the Children. Six out of the girls would eventually die and give birth, resulting in six catastrophes, leaving [SCP-231-7](https://alt-battles.fandom.com/wiki/SCP-231-7 "w:c:alt-battles:SCP-231-7") the last one. It is possible that the others died because the Procedure was based on the knowledge gathered by the Children and the Foundation had instead played into their plan.
