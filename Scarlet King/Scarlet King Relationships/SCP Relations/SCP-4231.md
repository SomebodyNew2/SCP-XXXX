A three-story house and residential business building in the now destroyed town of North Access, Cornwall, sitting at the top of the lakeside and consisting of a top story apartment, a ground-level local florist, and a basement. It was previously inhabited by two reality-benders [SCP-4231-B (Francis Wojciechowski)](https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Alto_Clef) "hero: Alto Clef ([[Dr. Clef]])") and his lover SCP-4231-A ([[Lilly]])](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/SCP-4231-A "SCP-4231-A"), the latter having become a worshiper of the Scarlet King ([[The Children]]) after finding the [[Erikesh Codex]] and used her powers to extend the basement into the earth under the lake. The basement connected to an ancient-looking chamber, designated SCP-4231-3, used to house [[SCP-231]], [[SCP-2317]] and a shrine dedicated to the King. The top floor, designated SCP-4231-2, consisted of a kitchen, a bathroom, a bedroom, a nursery, a living room, and an interconnecting hallway, all of which began existing as a pocket-dimension that each exhibited its unique properties as a result of [[Lilly]] abusing and torturing [[Francis]], causing the suffering to be imprinted on the environment in which it took place.
