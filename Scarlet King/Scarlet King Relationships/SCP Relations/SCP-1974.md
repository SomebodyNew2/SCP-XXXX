A bathtub that always had 148.2 litres of water, refilling itself when drained. When someone bathes in it they would hear the voices of an American man who claims to be the bathtub, designated SCP-1974-1, and a Russian man who claims to be the water, designated SCP-1974-2, having a heated debate about capitalism, communism and the state of the United States, Soviet Union and China. Following the death of SCP-6170, both of the entities abandoned their previous political views, now attempting to convince the person who uses the bathtub to transition to their new political ideology, Xebiotisum, which was similar to that of the idea of the Scarlet King's.
