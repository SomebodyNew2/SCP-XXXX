A hostile metamorphic entity known as the "Collections Liaison" entity that was created from an unpaid loan to Dr. Elena Jackson received from her former colleague Dr. Steve. As time went on the debt increased from $2.00 to $50,936,299,102.49 plus tax, 500 human souls, two truckloads of diamonds, the blood of a virgin, and a "goddamn pony". Dr. Jackson attempted to fix this by getting rid of Dr. Steve, but the latter had handed the case over to Scarlett & King Collections Agency which made sure to make the Foundation pay the debt which had increased to more money plus tax, 700 trillion condemned human souls, ownership of 53 timelines, while the blood of a virgin was resolved with Steve's death. In light of this, the Foundation was forced to periodically pay SCP-231-7 vast amounts of money to pay the debt, causing their credit rating to drop exponentially.
