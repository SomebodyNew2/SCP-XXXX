A group of thirty bottlenose dolphins modified by the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program and PENTAGRAM as an attempt to create soldiers capable of combatting SCP-3932-Δ but ended up betraying the US and joined the enemy faction. One of the modifications done to the dolphins was the integration of the Scarlet King's whale-like DNA into their biology, increasing their lifespan and size.
