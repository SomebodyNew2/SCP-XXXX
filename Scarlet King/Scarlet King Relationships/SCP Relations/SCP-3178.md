This event came as a result of Elder Rockwell of the [[The Christian Ministries of America|The Christian Ministries of America]] conducting his evil rituals in the village, disguising them as normal Baptist rites and slowly brainwashing all of the villagers who were unknowingly being deeply harmed. When Foundation Officers Efrain Rodr√≠guez and Connor Zhou came to investigate the anomaly they succumbed to it, resulting in them losing their minds and the former eventually being killed by Rockwell.
