An anomalous event plaguing the village of Whitewater, Mississippi, which caused some "miracles" to occur that at first seemed beneficial but were actually of sinister nature. This event came as a result of Elder Rockwell of the [[The Christian Ministries of America|The Christian Ministries of America]] conducting his evil rituals in the village, disguising them as normal Baptist rites and slowly brainwashing all of the villagers who were unknowingly being deeply harmed. When Foundation Officers Efrain Rodríguez and [[Conner Zhou]] came to investigate the anomaly they succumbed to it, resulting in them losing their minds and the former eventually being killed by Rockwell.

It's not like you can stop [God](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Scarlet_King "Scarlet King")'s march. The church is a conduit, Efrain, not a heart. God lives in the heart of every real American, and doing what you're gonna do will only embolden God.

~ [[Elder Rockwell]] to [[Agent Rodríguez]] from SCP-3178
