A modified bookcase which contains anomalous books casted out of the Wanderer's Library (Presumably [[The Library]]?) each designated as SCP-4982-1. One of the books from the "Mort" shelf titled _"Seven Vows For Seven Wives"_ bound in red coloured leather of indeterminate origin secreted a mixture of blood, human semen, and amniotic fluid while it was open.
