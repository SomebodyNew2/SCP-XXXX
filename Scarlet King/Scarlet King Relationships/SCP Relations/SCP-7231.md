The preserved corpse of Robert Montauk's brother, Researcher Jacob, which constantly produces blood and energy that causes portals and monsters to manifest, and was contained within a tomb by a ritual of Christian and [[Daevites]] nature. His death had been a non-anomalous accident, but because Robert blamed the [[Scarlet King]] for his disappearance the idea of the god assimilated Jacob into his being, turning Jacob into an aspect of him.
