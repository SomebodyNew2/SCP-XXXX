The preserved corpse of [[Robert Montauk]]'s brother, Researcher [[Jacob Montauk]], which constantly produces blood and energy that causes portals and monsters to manifest, and was contained within a tomb by a ritual of [[Christianity]] and [[Daevites]] nature. His death had been a non-anomalous accident, but because Robert blamed the [[Scarlet King]] for his disappearance the idea of the god assimilated Jacob into his being, turning Jacob into an aspect of him.
