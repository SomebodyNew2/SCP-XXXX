The ghost of a young girl named √Åine McGuinness haunting an English oak tree, designated SCP-7232-A, in an Appalachian mountain near an abandoned town from the 19th century. She had been killed in a ritual sacrifice by the local priest Father Whatley and the brothers James and John Thomas who were secretly members of the Children. The three culprits were then killed as revenge by her father Gofraidh McGuinness who was later hanged by the town from the tree, causing the ghost to manifest and mourn her father.
