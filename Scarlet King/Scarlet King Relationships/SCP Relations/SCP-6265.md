An ancient technological facility buried beneath the ground containing machinery that could create human beings. It was used by the nation of Camelot, which worshipped [[Mekhane]], to produce various warriors to aid them in times of war, one of which was Mordred who was created to serve as Arthur's heir to the throne. However, Mordred became an iteration of the [[Scarlet King]] and laid waste on the kingdom of Camelot before killing King Arthur.
