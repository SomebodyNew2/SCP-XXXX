#SCP-999 is a child of the [[Scarlet King]], but is also considered in some canon to be [[SCP-682]]'s sibling and therefore is a #Child-Of-The-Scarlet-King.

A mass living orange slime that is affectionate to any being it comes across, causing those it touches to laugh and be purged of any negative emotion. It is believed that it may be SCP-231-7's child who would use its ability to lighten the Scarlet King's heart. However, another claim stated that it was created by crazed former O5-10 named Dr. Charles Lambert using 231-7's placenta in a failed attempt to combat the Scarlet King.
