#SCP-682 is a spawn or avatar of destruction of the [[Scarlet King]]. Possibly a #Child-Of-The-Scarlet-King.

A reptile-like intelligent monster that it's near-impossible to be killed due to adapting to any anything. It believed to be one of the many offsprings of the [[Scarlet King]] and his Fourth Bride.

Lore status:

- In *[[SCP-2317]]* and *Scarlet King tales*, 682 is often discussed as a **spawn** or **avatar of destruction**, consistent with the King’s domain of entropy and malice.

- Some headcanon or deep lore suggests that SCP-682 and [[SCP-999]] are **siblings**, created for opposite purposes (destruction vs joy).


We're safely canonising 682 as a child of the Scarlet King in our mythos, we just have to anchor it clearly.

Include a recovered log or ritual text stating: “The Sixth-born, who devours hope and cannot die, shall know no peace until the Chains are shattered.”
