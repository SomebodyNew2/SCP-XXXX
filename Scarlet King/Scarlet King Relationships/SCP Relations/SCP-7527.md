The nonexistent American actor Sylvester "Slimmy" Kincaid, designated SCP-7527-A, and VHS tapes of the movies featuring him, designated SCP-7527-B, only seven of which were found. Slimmy Kincaid was a stand-in for the Scarlet King, played the role of the main character or a mentor figure with abnormal strength and reality-bending, was loved by every single character except for the antagonist, was never harmed, went through no character development, and taught the other characters and the audience that supremacy was the right thing to do and weak people should be sacrificed. If someone heard or viewed his name that person would be compelled to defend him. These movies were created through the collaboration with the Children of the Scarlet King as way to spread the word, and despite the Foundation claiming the remaining VHS tapes information regarding Slimmy Kincaid began to slowly spread.
