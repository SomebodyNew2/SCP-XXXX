An ancient small hardback book with 257 pages that described the interior of a version of [[Penmynydd Hall]] which had a doorway leading to a pocket-dimension resembling a theatre with changing geometries, and if readers intensely studied it their intestines would partially transmute into fired clay or kaolinite. According to the book, the doorway, which was located in the basement, couldn't be blocked by any means and would always be left opened, and theatre was comprised of several galleries, a stage and a stall which were partially stuck in time. On the stage rested a pile of corpses belonging to employees of His Majestyâ€™s Foundation for the Study of Curiosities and Phantasmagoria that had been sacrificed, and in the stalls were located four chairs, each designated SCP-7264-1 to -4, surrounding a large oval banquet table and reserved for the [[Hanged King]], his [[Ambassador]], a [[unknown nobleman]] and the [[Scarlet King]], though some readers stated there four other chairs behind the Ambassador's belonging to the Four [[Masked Lords of Alagadda]](?).
