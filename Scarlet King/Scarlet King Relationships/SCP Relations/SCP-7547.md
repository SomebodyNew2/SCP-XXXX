A big ritual comprised of several anomalous incidents instigated by Evan Boothe which revolved around the change through violence and aquatic life. These events included: the [[Manahiem Massacre]] in which [[Evan Boothe]] killed his former friends Austin, Sarah, Devin and Tyler, and transfigured their bodies into fishpeople covered in barnacles, though he spared his ex-boyfriend [[Adam Engle]] for the moment; the death of an unrecognizable shipping worker from a line that got mysteriously tightened and snapped; two cars crashing into each other on the Interstate 95 Highway caused by Boothe standing on the road, resulting in two casualties and the engines pouring saline water; [[Hefftone Assoc.]] employee [[Amy Smith]] going to the CEO's office with a wounded arm, doing something that convinced the CEO to improve the employees' working conditions while she completely disappeared; a hydro-electric plant employee [[George Willis]] spending his off hours around the [[Malcolm Dam]], bleeding and losing his hair throughout the facility, before an elephant seal emerged from the lake and Willis drowning in it; the snakehead fishes transforming into artiodactyls and diminishing the deer population of the [[Great Meadows National Reserve]]; the murder of the [[Blue Hills Correctional Facility]]'s security guards who were replaced by former prisoners of the facility, all covered up through an event similar to [[SCP-4288]] which resulted in the prisoner abuse declining; a fishing boat transforming into a living dolphin-like construction; and [[Samantha Hope]] decapitating her abusive boyfriend [[Jeffery Smith]] before impaling it on a wooden pike, at which point it attained the property of making observers believe it was the head of their closest loved one. This ritual eventually culminated when Adam Engle, who began working for the Foundation and was designated SCP-7547-OMEGA, began investigating these incidents, leading to Boothe finally reuniting with his lover and killing him at last.
