A #CK-Class reality restructuring scenario that changed reality as a result of the battle between SCP-8008-B and [[ΔT]]. SCP-8008-B had used his reality-bending powers to restructure reality to an erotic fantasy setting, known as Eluthertopia, in which he was the absolute champion and utilized the destructive magic of the [[Scarlet King]]. He was opposed by ΔT, a group of time travelers that were trapped in Eluthertopia which included 77 versions of [[Robert Montauk]], who sought to kill him in order to return everything to normal. As part of their assassination attempt was performing a ritual involving the Scarlet King which would be counteracted by the Mother Goddess [[SCP-597]], and appeared to have partially worked in killing SCP-8008-B.
