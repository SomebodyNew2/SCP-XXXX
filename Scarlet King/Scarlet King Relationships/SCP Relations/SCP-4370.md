A growing underground structure accessible through several abandoned facilities belonging to the GoI [[Olney Ironworks]]. Its growth in size coincides with the middle-class economic anxiety and although its interior its bigger than its outside appearance it contains a consistent structure. It is also inhabited by a red fleshy humanoid creature designated SCP-4370-1 that was previously seen in Rodríguez's dream while in his stay in Whitewater. It was apparently created by [[Elder Rockwell]] and [[Orvo]] to get back at [[Olney]], but when [[Conner Zhou]] became lost inside the structure Orvo with the assistance of 4370-1 killed him and stole his skin to infiltrate the Foundation.
