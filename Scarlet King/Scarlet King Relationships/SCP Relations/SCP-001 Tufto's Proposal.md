The living idea of the Scarlet King about the clash between the pre-modern and modern world which resulted in the creation of the evil god which plagued the world. Because he was a concept birthed from human thought and emotion, he couldn't be vanquished from the world without killing the people aware of him or holding the same sentiment as those that worshiped him, though he was influenced by human belief, incorporating previously unrelated histories, beings and groups into itself, rewriting the past to match the belief held by the majority of humans who knew about him. The Children upon learning of the Scarlet King became haunted by the idea and decided to accomplish his purpose for existing by abolishing modernity, while the Foundation decided to classify him as Safe in a futile attempt to make him appear less threatening and as a result diminish his power.
