A version of [Dr. King](https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Everett_King "w:c:hero:Everett King") from SCP-6747-A3, a pocket-dimension based on the main reality created through the imagination of fictional scenarios, that had been corrupted by SCP-2747 and turned into a incarnation of the [[Scarlet King]]. Existing as an anti-narrative complex, King sought to ascend through the narrative layers of reality to fight 2747, but was stopped by the Foundation by turning his fictional setting into a comedic parody of their universe, coming to be known as "lolFoundation", though it appeared he had the last laugh.
