[SCP-5991](https://scponecanonproject.fandom.com/wiki/SCP-5991-%E2%84%96 "w:c:scponecanonproject:SCP-5991-№"): The appearance of a pale eyeless humanoid creature wearing a crown of thorns with a large toothless maw that swallows anyone who consumes a Bible to send them to a educational theme park named [[JesusLand]] inside its stomach-like pocket-dimension which they can leave any time. The creature was originally a powerful monster named [[Ero'Vahk]] who served the Scarlet King by transporting his armies within its stomachs to ambush their enemies, but eventually it betrayed the Scarlet King and converted to Christianity, wishing to serve the Creator instead.
