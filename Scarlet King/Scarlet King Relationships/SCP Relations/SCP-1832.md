A man named [[Jonathan Baker]] who possessed the power to heal others, but his capacity would diminish when trying to heal people afflicted with terminal diseases, and could only regain his energy from the suffering of those around him. He used this property to pose as a wandering faith healer who travelled through rural Southern United States attempting to heal the poor's ill children, but would deliberately let them die and accuse the families that they had turned their back on God, causing them great pain which not only fuelled him but also made him feel like God. In [[SCP-7324]], it was revealed that Baker is the director of [[The Christian Ministries of America]]'s Youth League.
