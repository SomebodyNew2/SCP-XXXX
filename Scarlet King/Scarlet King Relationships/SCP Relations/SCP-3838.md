**Eight** [[Ancient steppe tribe]] originating from western Turkmenistan near the Caspian Sea. After the creation of the [[Scarlet King]], the [[Eighth tribe]], designated [SCP-3838-8](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/SCP-3838-8 "SCP-3838-8") became some of his servants and fought against other seven Turkmen tribes which were able to defeat the evil tribe and bind their god through their seven urns, but were all scattered throughout time forcing them to occupy the same lands in different periods of time. [[Jack Hearst]] with the assistance of his fellow Children utilised his #reality-bending powers to possess the body of one of the eighth tribe's soldiers to learn more about the King, but was left severely disturbed from the experience and left the cult while not knowing the full truth.
