An abandoned apartment in Ukraine that constantly changes its size and appearance while various random things and beings manifest in it. This was due to a sentient fetus with reality-bending powers affecting its surroundings after its mother tried to abort it, causing the fetus to be left in a toilet and transforming its mother into a septic tank. It is believed in #Operation-MAGNOLIA that a similar more disastrous event may transpire with SCP-231-7's child.
