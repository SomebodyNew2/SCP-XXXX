A performance done by thaumaturgist [[Hana Hong]], a more benevolent member of [[the Children]] and [[AWCY]]?, in which a pot of a thorn tree upon being approached by Hong would set every nearby object of affiliation, including uniforms, name tags, company-issued key cards, and religious items, on fire, while a gramophone would emit screams of humans during the inferno. Once the fire extinguishes, red ashes would be left behind, at which point Hong planned to hand out to the spectators pamphlets about the benevolent side of the Scarlet King's worshipers. Hong wished to show people that the Scarlet King's religion didn't start out as evil and was twisted through time, but faced difficulty due to arson being prohibited in the district they planned to execute their performance.
