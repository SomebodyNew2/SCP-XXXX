In [[SCP-6140]]Around 2022, a sect of the Children broke inside the home of [Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Marshall,_Carter_and_Dark,_Ltd. "Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.") associate Richard Bruce and stole his copy of [SCP-140](https://evil.fandom.com/wiki/SCP-140 "w:c:evil:SCP-140") since they planned to use it as part of their ritual to bring back the Daevite Empire. They took the book to a house in Elgin, Moray, Scotland and in the winter solstice they performed a thaumaturgic ritual which involved the ignition of the book. MTF Mu-3 were able to track the sect down and tried to intervene but were too late as the ritual was successfully completed and the Daevites were expected to remanifest on the vernal equinox. However, on March 20, because [[SCP-140]] was a false history created by [[Thomas Bruce]] who used occult magic to turn it into reality and rewriting the real Daevites, its destruction resulted with the [[Daevites]] reverting to a normal civilisation with all of the related anomalies ceasing to exist. Since the Scarlet King was completely made up by 140-A as part of 140, [[The Children]] of the Scarlet King also seemingly ceased to exist as they had never actually formed.
