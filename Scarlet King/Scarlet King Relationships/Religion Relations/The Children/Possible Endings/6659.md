After the Foundation constructed [[SCP-6659]][](https://alt-battles.fandom.com/wiki/SCP-6659 "w:c:alt-battles:SCP-6659"), an #eigenweapon developed for the neutralisation of hostile deific entities from within the noosphere, they tested it on the deity worshipped by [[the Children]] in order to have them dissolved. Upon using SCP-6659 on the [[Scarlet King]], they successfully trapped him within a sacrificial dagger which acted as his totem. However, various groups of the cult continued existing and still operated post-activation 007, since the magic used by the leaders of the cult had actually no real relation to the Scarlet King, but instead it was possibly related to [[SCP-2747]](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/SCP-2747 "SCP-2747"), with the King being only a manifestation of the being.
