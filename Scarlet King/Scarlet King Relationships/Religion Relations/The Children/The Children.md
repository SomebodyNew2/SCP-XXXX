The Children are known to form alliances with some organizations in order to achieve their goals. Examples include the [[Fourth Reich of the Obskurakorps]] [Obskurakorps](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Ahnenerbe_Obskurakorps "Ahnenerbe Obskurakorps") and the [[Foundation Elimination Coalition]] which recruited numerous "Children" in their ranks.

The [[Scarlet King/Scarlet King Relationships/Religion Relations/The Children/The Christian Ministries of America/The Christian Ministries of America]], seem to have an animosity with the metalworking industrial conglomerate known as [[Olney Ironworks]], although they both used a compound known as BLACK FLY which served to brainwash people to their cause. Radical feminist Dunst Amherst of the Fourth Reich and [Just Girly Things](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Just_Girly_Things "Just Girly Things") was associated with Elder Rockwell but was unsatisfied with his work to squash the minorities she saw as problematic.

Unsurprisingly, both [[Sarkicism]][](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Sarkicism "Sarkicism") and the [[Church of the Second Hytoth]][](https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_the_Second_Hytoth "w:c:hero:Church of the Second Hytoth") are hostile to the Children, due not only their evil beliefs and practices that go against their ideals, but also due sharing the same religion with the Daevites, the two religions' mortal enemies. The CMA even demonized their divine figures in its take of Christianity.

A member of [[Parawatch]][](https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Parawatch "w:c:hero:Parawatch") from England during their youth befriended a punk kid named Ethan who was secretly a member of the Children. Ethan led this individual to an old abandoned church that was taken over by the cult, where the individual's mind and personality was shattered after encountering the force of the Scarlet King.

Due to the cults close relationship with the [[GoC]], [[Goldbaker-Reinz Insurance Group Ltd.]][](https://scp-db.fandom.com/wiki/Goldbaker-Reinz_Ltd. "w:c:scp-db:Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd.") worked tirelessly in suppressing financing to terroristic religious extremists like the Children.

The Children appeared to have a hostile relationship with the [[Chaos Insurgency]][](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos_Insurgency "Chaos Insurgency") as the latter once attacked the cult, rescuing [[Jacob Montauk]] who joined the Insurgency as gratitude.

[[Phantasos Ltd.]], a subsidiary of the [[Oneiroi Collective]][](https://scp-db.fandom.com/wiki/Oneiroi_Collective "w:c:scp-db:Oneiroi Collective"), appeared to have opposed [[Evan Boothe]] as it alarmed [[AWCY]]? member [[Wally Mannington]] and a [[MC&D employee]] to warn Boothe's future victims like [[Adam Engle]]. Unfortunately this proved to have been all in vain.

The Children and other groups serving the [[Scarlet King]] were directly opposed by the [[BASALT GORGON mystery cult]] and [[related organisations]], since they worshiped the benevolent [[Goddess Sanna]] and sought to extinguish the King's influence on Earth. The BASALT GORGON cult would sacrifice members of the Children to Sanna in order to restore her power.
