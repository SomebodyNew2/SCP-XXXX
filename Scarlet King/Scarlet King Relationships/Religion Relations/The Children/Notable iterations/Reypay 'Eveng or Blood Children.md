An iteration of the Children on [[SCP-4547]], the planet of Mo'ara, previously inhabited by the alien race known as the taronyu. One of the catastrophes which affected the planet wereÂ SCP-4547-B4, [[Scarlet Spawn]]s of the Scarlet King which were seemingly born from some of the taronyu after the cult performed some rituals. However, due to their world having ended and the King's spawn dying on their thrones, this iteration saw their mission as completed and as a result became less violent and hostile than their human counterpart, and didn't share the same beliefs as them.
