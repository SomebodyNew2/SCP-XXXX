A Malaysian extremist street gang which seeks to revoke the Malaysian citizenship from non-Malay Malaysians through violent means, such as force-feeding religious minorities forbidden food. At first they were not considered an iteration of the Children of the Scarlet King mostly due to being Muslim, but was soon discovered that the King played an important role in their iconography and justifications, as well as utilizing thaumaturgy associated with the Children.
