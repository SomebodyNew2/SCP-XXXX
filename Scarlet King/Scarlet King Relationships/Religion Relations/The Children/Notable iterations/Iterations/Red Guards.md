[[Iteration of The Children]]
A group which sought to use blood and bones that were carved with the [[SCP Foundation]]'s logo, as well as spinal fluids of several animals, to combine them with a ritual chanting in order to open a portal to the [[Scarlet King]]'s realm while invoking Foundation protection. They came close to success, but a mistake in the words of the ritual caused their ceremony to end up in a massive explosion, killing and wiping out almost all of the Guards.
