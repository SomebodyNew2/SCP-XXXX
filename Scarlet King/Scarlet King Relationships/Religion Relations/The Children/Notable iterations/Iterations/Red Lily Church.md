[[Iteration of The Children]]
A Korean cult that kidnapped infants and sacrificed people to revive the [[Scarlet King]]. Most of the cult was eradicated by the Foundation's [[Site-145K]], but seven members managed to escape and went on to kill more people in their god's name, including a Foundation doctor and his wife, though sparing his grandson Lee Hyo-in, who became a Foundation agent to take revenge for his family's death.
