Although most believe that the Children of the Scarlet King only seek to summon their deity to their world to have it destroyed, the ultimate goal of the Children and its various iterations, in essence, is to establish a hierarchy around the world where the strong violently rule over the weak, and possibly enslave humanity and make themselves its rulers. They seek to summon the King to render the world into a post-apocalyptic wasteland that would allow them to demolish equality and the modern way of life, opting to return to ancient feudalism. Although some of the Children claim to want to achieve this in order to get rid of the Scarlet King, since once his purpose is finally fulfilled the idea of him would become inactive, most of them genuinely believe in their ideology and it becomes especially apparent in those groups which started out without the inclusion of the King in their beliefs.
