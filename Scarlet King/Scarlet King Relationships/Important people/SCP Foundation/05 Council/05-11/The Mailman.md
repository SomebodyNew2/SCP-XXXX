#05-11
Possibly [an actual mailman](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-high-court-with-the-magic-army) for the [[High Court Magic Army]] before appointment to the council. O5-11's most well-known role is to sign off on Termination Orders of Class D personnel, versus approving their transfer to another Site. Whether all Class D are terminated at Sites due to anomalous exposure, or merely transferred to another site, O5-11 makes the final decision.

Confirmed to have held at least one other O5 number, though the number itself is unknown. May be an indication of a standard number changeover process, or perhaps of unknown internal political manoeuvring.

Male. European descent. Eastern European origin. 80+. No unusual appearance. Eerily similar appearance to [[The Hermit]] and because they have been confirmed to have held at least one other 05 number it is possible they used to be an #05-3.
