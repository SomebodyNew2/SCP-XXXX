#05-4 #Chaos

Defected during the #Foundation-Civil-War after making an alliance with then #05-7 [[The Heretic]] and then #05-11 [[The Keeper or, The Warden]]. They designed the first iteration of the [[Chaos Insurgency/Chaos Insurgency|Chaos Insurgency]] with [[The Professor or, The Heretic]], known as the Foundation Black Ops project. He was however not a mastermind of the "true" [[Chaos Insurgency/Chaos Insurgency]]. When he defected he took all of his connections with him effectively splitting the Foundation, this was possibly during a time period of 1915-1947 based on the age of Al Capone who he was related to.

Because they deflected during the foundation civil war it would mean that this is the same timeline as [[The Man With The Infinity Gun]].
