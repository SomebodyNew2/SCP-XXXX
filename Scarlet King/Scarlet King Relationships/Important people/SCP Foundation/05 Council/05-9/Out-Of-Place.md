#05-9 #Forbidden-City-Convention 
Formerly affiliated with the Inner Africa Expeditionary Society funded by King Leopold of Belgium, and are a signatory of the [[Forbidden City Convention]](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wrong-proposal). They prompted the 05 Council to declassify a previous iteration of [[SCP-1851]]. They carry an interest towards the concept of "anchoring reality" and set aside a trust fund to research on counter-onto kinetic stratagems, essentially leading to the discovery of Humes. Possibly in preparation against an onto kinetic threat?
