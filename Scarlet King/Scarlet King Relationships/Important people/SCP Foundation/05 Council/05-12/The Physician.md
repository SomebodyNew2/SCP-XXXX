#05-12 #Forbidden-City-Convention 
Signatory of the [[Forbidden City Convention]] (https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wrong-proposal). Abnormality Institute (異學會; yì xué huì), sometimes called 'Chinese Abnormality Institute', believed to have been invited to join the O5 Council only because of his knowledge of a "memory-altering drug" (i.e. amnestics).

Collaborated with the Chinese Nationalist Army to eliminate (betray?) the Meng clan; rationale is to monopolise amnestics for the Foundation. Coined the term 'Safe'. Rudimentary knowledge of English.

Male. East Asian descent. Chinese origin. Appears to be 70
