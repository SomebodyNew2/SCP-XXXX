[Former top Foundation field agent](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ecceperago)ï»¿([[Ecce Perago]] is a tale and as such not to be entirely trusted.)

May be a member of the Bright family. Known as a jack of all trades and is seen often in public. He focuses on foundation security.

For his military record to be true he'd have to be one of the oldest Council Member, possibly making him a #Founding-Member. But he would have to have some way of extending his life before joining the foundation, or it could be a blatant fabrication. Maybe it's worth looking into.

Male. European descent. American origin. Mid-40s. Long hair kept in a ponytail.
