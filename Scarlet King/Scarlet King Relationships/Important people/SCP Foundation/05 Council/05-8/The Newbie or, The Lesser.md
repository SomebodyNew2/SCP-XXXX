#05-8
First action as 05 council was to approve [[Dr. Kondraki]] plan to neutralise the former #SCP-083, this resulted in the breaching of multiple SCP objects, including Kondraki deliberately breaching #SCP-682. This would make him the likely cause of the birth/creation of [[Frost]]. He was not removed from the council but never recovered from the incident. Possibly assassinated as he has not appeared in public in a long time.

Male. European descent. American origin. Mid-30s. No unusual appearance.
