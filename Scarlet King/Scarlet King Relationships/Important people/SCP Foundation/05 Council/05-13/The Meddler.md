#05-13
#Felix-Carter based off of a tale could be inaccurate, read into. Most reports of O5-13 result from the conflicts he starts or becomes involved in, no one outside the O5 Council appears to be aware of this O5 member's role in the Foundation, the role he generally seems to play in practice is interfering with other O5 members' projects.

Known for ranting about how other O5 members (and lower-ranked Foundation personnel) are not running operations correctly, not a particularly popular O5 Council member. Surprisingly, reports do not indicate many assassination attempts.

Male. European descent. American origin. Mid-30s. No unusual appearance.
