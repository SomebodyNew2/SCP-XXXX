Claims that Death itself was bound by the O5 Council in the early 19th century, [SCP-006](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-006) #SCP-006 does not exist; the longevity of O5s actually stems from O5-13. When used, it is typically on a mass scale — [SCP-2000](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2000) #SCP-2000 and similar anomalous items also do not exist and are used as cover for every time that Council has voted to utilize O5-13's power to return most of the world's population back to life.

O5 Council's immortality comes from [imprisoning Death](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tanhony-s-proposal) #tanhony-s-proposal, Or from residing in [a location](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spikebrennan-s-proposal) shielded from the processes that cause mortality. Alternative reports claim that the Administrator, not O5-13, has [assumed the role](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4260) of Death.
