[KTE-2013-Kapala-Mendes](https://scp-db.fandom.com/wiki/KTE-2013-Kapala-Mendes "w:c:scp-db:KTE-2013-Kapala-Mendes"):Â A set of seven ancient spears possessed by the demonic servants of the Scarlet King, each designated Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot and Golf. They are capable of opening portals, whose size is determined by the presence of the spears, to a dimension inhabited by other monstrous servants known as KTE-2032-Ragweed-Mendes. Apart from that they can manifest human and pig blood on themselves and their surroundings, induce nightmares to those in their proximity which eventually leads to the subjects developing phobias and hallucinations, cause a quick hemorrhagic disease when used to pierce someone's skin, and when wielded by someone the demons trapped within would possess the wielder and go to gather the other spears. Each spear also possess their own unique properties such as controlling any individual who gets pierced, transmuting water into blood to attract vermin, cause a contagious hemorrhagic disease and nonsense #cognitohazardous vocalisations, inflicting an accelerated version of the hemorrhagic disease, grant its wielder pyrokinesis and hallucination inducement before dying of organ failure, and grant its wielder interdimensional travel while making them mute. It is believed that [[The Children]] have still in their possession the seventh spear which has yet to be obtained by the [[GoC]].
