**Description:**

SCP-001 is a theoretical entity defined as the potential cause for another anomalous phenomenon, SCP-001-1. SCP-001-1 is the collective designation for a set of documents that were inexplicably uploaded to the SCP-001 file location on 1970/01/01. While SCP-001-1 suggest the existence of SCP-001, their legitimacy is unknown, and is ultimately of no significance. Any effects SCP-001 is implied to have caused have been seemingly reverted and **any additional information concerning SCP-001 is irrelevant**.

SCP-001-1 resemble Foundation documents, each one documenting a different iteration of SCP-001. At the same time that SCP-001-1 were uploaded, Dir. Jones became aware of the necessary measures for SCP-001's containment and subsequently authored this document. For details regarding SCP-001-1, [contact RAISA Director Maria Jones.](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/mcdoctorate-s-proposal/offset/1)
