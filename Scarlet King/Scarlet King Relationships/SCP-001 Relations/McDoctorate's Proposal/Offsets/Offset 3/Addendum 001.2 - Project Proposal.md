## Project Proposal 001-KH-1

**DATE:** 2001/07/05

---

The latest SCP-001-1 document appears to imply that the component entities of SCP-001 are destabilizing as "The [[Archival Form]]" attempts to inhibit the effects of "The [[Primordial Form]]". This corresponds with an increase in fractured timelines and conflicting causalities, as detected by the Department of Temporal Anomalies.

As such, I am formally proposing Project 001-KH-1, to study SCP-001 and the relationship between its component entities. If methods of influencing SCP-001 are found, Project 001-KH-1 is to pursue any available means of re-balancing SCP-001's component entities.

If the Primordial Form is weakened so as to pose sufficient risks to baseline causality, it is to be revived through collective belief and perception. Personnel are to be reminded of the significance of SCP-001.
