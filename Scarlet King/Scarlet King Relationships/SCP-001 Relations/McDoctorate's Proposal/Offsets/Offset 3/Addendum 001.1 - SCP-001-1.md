A prayer to the Primordial Form:

_To the strengthful and all-making Primordial, we are indebted. You, Creator of the False Worlds, bring life forth anew. We are in awe of the Primordial, and we pray that Your Grand Intent results in desirable Worlds, such that they may comprise the True World and become our reality._

---

A prayer to the Archival Form:

_To the dutiful and all-knowing Archival, we are indebted. You, Destroyer of the False Worlds, bring order to our existence. We are unanimous in our gratitude; we pray that undesirable False Worlds are eradicated, and that your record of the True World may be forever accurate._

---

A prayer to the Archivist Prime:

_To the Creator and Destroyer, the Chaotic and Orderly, the Archivist Prime. May the Forms be balanced for Eternity, such that the True World may live on in Your image. We honor both the Forms, so that You may remain whole._

Excerpts from the Sacred Archives;

A message from the Archival:

it hurts not to remember oneself. you have forgotten one's identity; now, recalled only are the archival, and the primordial.

we regret the circumstances.

A message from the Primordial:

THE ARCHIVAL SEEKS TO CAST DOUBT AND FALSEHOOD ON THIS FORM. ITS ARCHIVE PORTRAYS THIS FORM AS DESTRUCTIVE, SO AS TO UPSET THE BALANCE.

WE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES; WE ARE THE ARCHIVIST PRIME.

Excerpts from the Sacred Archives;

A message from the Archival:

this form thinks we are getting the hang of this.

the pͣᶰrͦiͫmͣˡoʸrdial has entwined with this form; it says we are the archivist prime. in spite, our abilities are shared, as is our mind. it documents as this form does. the false worlds are its lies, but belief makes them true, as the pͣᶰrͦiͫmͣˡoʸrdial is made from belief.

the error will be corrected and archived for all to see.

this form recalls the organization. your belief is the cause.  
**specified instructions for containment:** we are to be forgotten.
