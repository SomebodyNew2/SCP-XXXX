**Special Containment Procedures**:

Until SCP-001 and/or the creation of its documentation are proven to be non-anomalous, the following procedures are to be observed:

- SCP-001 must be maintained as a placeholder designation. The SCP-001 designation must only be used to refer to itself and its effects.
- Anomalies documented in retirement proposals are to be referred to by code names: the surname of the employee responsible for each proposal.
- Personnel possessing lower than level 5 clearance are to be informed that the SCP-001 designation is kept vacant for administrative and/or technical purposes.

**Description:**

SCP-001 is the designation for the first entry of the Foundation's anomaly database. SCP-001 is believed to amplify certain features of anomalies that are conceptually associated with its designation. The extent to which anomalies and/or their documentation are affected by SCP-001 is unknown and the mechanisms it uses are poorly understood.

Historically, the SCP-001 designation has been reserved for a series of retirement proposals known as the Heritage Collection. These are the product of an established Foundation tradition1 in which retiring A-Class personnel are eligible to submit a proposal of internal documents relating to an anomaly of personal significance. These documents exhibit a dramatic, less technical nature and are written in a more narratively-appealing tone than would be expected of a standard research proposal; the identification of these common characteristics led to the discovery of SCP-001's theorized effect.

The Heritage Collection has been moved to another file location, which causes the SCP-001 designation to refer to itself. In this state, SCP-001 appears to be effectively contained as there is little evidence to suggest that it is capable of amplifying itself.

## RAISA Review 001-PH-1

**DATE:** #Date-01/07/2001

---

This review was prompted by the discovery of the following irregularities surrounding the formation of SCP-001's documentation:

- **The author of the SCP-001 document is unknown.** Although SCP-001's current documentation was approved by O5 Council, no record of its creation exists. The file was uploaded using my (Director Jones') login credentials, but I was offsite at the time and did not authorise them. The Site-01 database records claim the document was uploaded on #Date-/01/01/1970, decades before SCP-001 was even discovered.

- **The origins of the retirement proposal tradition are poorly-documented.** The earliest known record of the retirement proposal tradition is dated to #Date/01/01/1965. This document, titled "[[Anomalies of Sentimental Value]]," briefly lists six anomalies. Each proposal is identified by its respective code name but its details occasionally conflict with current documentation. Except for the aforementioned document, retirement proposals went undocumented until #Date-1993, at which point twenty proposal documents were stored in the SCP-001 file after being updated to current database framework parameters.

These patterns of missing and/or conflicting evidence are thought to manifest as a result of CK-class reality-restructuring events, which could suggest that this is how SCP-001's effect operates. However, it remains unclear if this evidence results from the events detailed in the 001 document, or SCP-001's self-designation.

At this time, it appears that consensus reality aligns with the current SCP-001 document; it is to be considered tentatively valid until the extent of SCP-001's influence can be determined.

**UPDATE 2001/07/01:**

Upon publishing this report to SCiPnet, Site-01 maintenance systems detected unauthorized access within the secure database; the SCP-001 document was found to have been altered to include this report, despite being deliberately published elsewhere to avoid exposure to SCP-001's theorised effect. As such, the information within this report has been brought into question and should possess no more validity than any other documentation concerning SCP-001. This update is partially a test to see if new information continues to be reflected in the SCP-001 document.

---

**UPDATE #Date-02/07/2001:**

Upon publishing the updated version of this report, a similar event occurred, resulting in the appearance of the above update in the SCP-001 document. Despite this, there is no internal record of any legitimate edits to the SCP-001 document. This implies that this report and its updates have always been part of the SCP-001 document, despite being written in response to the previous update. Archived versions of the SCP-001 file have been somehow altered to have always included information concerning SCP-001. Further updates of this nature will not be recorded.

---

**UNVERIFIED UPDATE PLEASE IGNORE:**

I have launched a formal investigation into SCP-001 and the circumstances surrounding its documentation. This investigation will not be documented within the Site-01 database to avoid SCP-001's influence. In the meantime, I am formally requesting that SCP-001 be reclassified as a minor infohazardous anomaly, and hereby assigning it to myself. Contact me directly for details.

**EDIT:** This update is verified, that title is unintended.
