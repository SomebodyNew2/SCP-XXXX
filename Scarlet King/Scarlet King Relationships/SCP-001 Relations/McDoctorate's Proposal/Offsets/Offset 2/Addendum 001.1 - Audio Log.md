<**BEGIN LOG**>

<Twenty-five seconds of ring tone. After the ringing ceases, a message begins to play. Female voice begins mid-sentence.>

UNKNOWN: —else I'll be able to hide. I have no clue why this way is safe. Maybe a landline phone is perceived as an insignificant way of storing information? Shit, I'm messing it up by thinking about it.

<_A crash of some kind is heard, followed by a brief silence._>

**UNKNOWN:** Okay, focus. Whoever's listening, my name is **STATIC SOUNDS** and I am real. Or, at least, I was. I need you to remember me. Once the anomaly gets to me, I'll be subject to its rules. You need to perceive that I exist. You need to believe in me.

UNKNOWN: As for the anomaly… SCP-001 is irrelevant. The best thing you can do is leave it alone. Don't look into it, don't think about it. Don't do anything special to try and get rid of it. You'll only make it worse.

The unidentified voice sighs.

UNKNOWN: I think it's devouring me now.

END LOG

AFTERWORD: This recording is believed to be manufactured by SCP-001 to prevent its containment. Amnestics administered to appropriate personnel per O5 order.
