## RAISA Update 001-PD-1

#Date-05/07/2001

---

Counterconceptual has confirmed that SCP-001 is not antimemetic in nature and that there is no evidence of SCP-001-A's supposed office ever being included in Site-01's floor plan. Several methods of memetic interrogation have also verified that no Foundation personnel show signs of memory insertion or alterations, suggesting that the anomaly's reality-restructuring is complete enough to be virtually undetectable.

Since SCP-001 was discovered, I have not experienced any unusual difficulty while executing recordkeeping duties. As far as I am aware, no part of my past or present performance indicates unusual influence or reality-alteration. Until such a time that SCP-001-A makes contact with the Foundation, its nonexistence is to be assumed.

Due to the scope of SCP-001's effect, I am re-designating the anomaly as Keter, effective immediately.
