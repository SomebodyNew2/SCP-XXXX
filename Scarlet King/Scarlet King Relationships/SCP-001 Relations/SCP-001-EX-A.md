A group of ancient machines capable of producing soda through a thaumaturgical ritual involving coca leaves. An ancient group of [[Erikeshans]] that worshiped the [[Scarlet King]] found the machines and considered them to be holy as they deemed the drink to have curative properties. Eventually, the [[Erikeshan commune]] was exterminated by businessman Robert Turner who claimed the machines for himself which led to the formation of the Coca-Cola Company. The Foundation sought to use the drink to combat SCP-001-PIG-EX which was causing a decline in marriage and increase of children born outside of marriage.
