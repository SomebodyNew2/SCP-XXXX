3 possibilities of his capabilities:

Anomalous: This would make them a God like entity, or at least capable of making body doubles. This branch is highly unlikely.

Not anomalous: #UIU, #GoC, #Fifthist fanatic, Inside man for the #Chaos Insurgency (Unlikely, how could one insurgent set off all of the nukes.), #Serpents-hand (Unlikely they don't operate like this).

Had help: #Ethics-Committee, #Administrator , Both of the forementioned. This branch is the highest likelihood because of the [[Letter sent by the Administrator]].
