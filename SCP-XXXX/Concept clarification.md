[[Concept]]

1. Although I state that they are secret protectors of humanity who kill to keep knowledge hidden, what I truly meant was that the higher ups, the ones that determine what the lower ranks do know about and are trying to keep the knowledge hidden, which plays into the fact that nobody actually knows what the higher ups of the foundation actually wants 
2. I was planning on adding log hints as to the direction of the world and what outcome it is leading to 
3. The Chaos IS antagonistic to the Foundation, they think they're a thumb in the plan on preventing the descent of the Scarlet King 
4. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">1940 was a typo I meant to say "1924"</mark>  
5. Because the records are done under the Foundation, I wanted to make it so that the Foundation doesn't realise that SCP-XXXX is what's actually preventing the descent of the Scarlet King, so they mark the file as Keter and lock it in a Cognito-hazard vault which in term sparks its power, which then gets picked up by the Foundation which may cause them to look into the SCP which will also in term weakens the SCP which would cause the descent of the Scarlet King 
6. The SCP is the CHAIN that links the Scarlet King and his children but also keeps the Scarlet King from descending, it is a concept rather then a conscious meaning that as the lore states, 6 of the chains have broken, this is the final one and it is hanging on just by the sheer fact that it got locked in the Cognito-hazard vault and sparked extreme near omnipotent strength 
7. The Foundation thinks it's world ending which then plays into the fact that it's preventing an Apollyon level event from happening; the descent of the Scarlet King, BUT what it's actually doing is chaining the SCP meaning it's actually a Thaumial SCP 
8. Correct, Scarlet King lore itself is extremely inconsistent which is why I want to make my own head canon consolidated the known and created the knew, as such creating a proper canon for the Scarlet King for others to follow and expand on. 
9. I don't really want it to be similar to 055, because I want this SCP to be able to technically "control" a human or infiltrate the minds of humans to prevent the spread of its idea, that being the concept of the chains (Not really but metaphorically) 1
10. This will be my final comment(s): A lot of internal logic isn't really heavily emphasises because I haven't actually gotten to it, it's a concept, not a finalised idea, the only thing I am sure I want to do is make the Chaos technically "good," in the fact that they are preventing the Scarlet King's descent, and I want the foundation to be unknown as to what SCP-XXXX actually is, thus causing a direct Chaos vs Foundation scenario 
11. The children of the Scarlet King are actually mentioned in the file, the literal children, they are; <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">SCP-231, SCP-3178, SCP-999, SCP-682, SCP-058</mark> (at least I believe that's true, I might've added 1 that isn't actually one of his children, but that's just an example ignore it if so) 
12. Because the Scarlet King is related to SCP-682, that therefore weighs in the fact that it is related to SCP-5000, just by the fact that SCP-5000 has HEAVY plot points that stem from SCP-682 
13. The people that originally knew of SCP-XXXX were administered anti-memetics and "It was once locked in a cognito-hazardous containment file and the file was auto-deleted.", I believe I forgot to add that quote in the original question. 
14. Also even based off of the fact that people were administered anti-memetics the concept can choose who remembers it after it gains the strength, i.e if almost all of the people administered anti-memetics completely forget it, it gets stronger and after it gets stronger it will target the people that still remember it until there are none left that "oppose its direction," it doesn't have a conscious but it has a will and that will skips over the Chaos Insurgency because their goal is to prevent the descent of the Scarlet King. 
15. The recovery from loops can be impacted from SCP-XXXX, it's not the same as the time "reset" that occurs from SCP-055. (Ask questions about this to expand as I myself need to draw some conclusions that have not been made) 
16. The concept keeps them battling, this outcome isn't exactly easy to discuss but think of it that the concept has gained the strength to influence the entire world, if this occurs I would think of it that there is only one person that remembers SCP-XXXX, that person being the Engineer and the engineer is the one that continues this fight, it's just that each side keeps fighting and it's almost like a stalemate, I might make it so that it's not necessarily a stalemate but both sides lose which then results in the outcome where the chain becomes omnipotentantly strong, which would be way to similar to that outcome but I don't know I might need to expand on that. 
17. I need some middle ground similar to SCP-5000, but I don't want to do it in that way I feel like making it so that a side character or something of the like is killed mercilessly and it goes down a path if they lived, or possibly just their life story months prior
