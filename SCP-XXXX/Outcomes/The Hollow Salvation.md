[[Outcomes]]

1. The Chaos Insurgency succeeds in "removing" the human population, reducing knowledge of the SCP to zero. The SCP becomes omnipotently strong, effectively binding the Scarlet King in an eternal, inescapable prison within the void of non-existence. However, the price is not just human life, but the absolute cessation of all sapient thought and experience. The "chains" are complete, but there's no one left to witness the victory, no one to suffer the King's absence, and no one to truly comprehend the peace that has been achieved. It's a victory so complete it renders itself meaningless to any living observer. The "lack of suffering" isn't a relief, it's just... nothing. This outcome isn't an "end of suffering," it's the end of everything capable of suffering or not suffering.
