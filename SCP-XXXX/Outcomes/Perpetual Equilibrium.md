[[Outcomes]]

1. The endless conflict isn't just about the Foundation and Chaos Insurgency clashing. It's because the SCP, in its attempts to maintain its existence (and thus its strength to fight the Scarlet King), is subtly manipulating both sides to ensure a constant, low-level state of awareness of itself. If the Foundation fully suppresses it, it weakens. If the Chaos Insurgency fully unleashes it (by eliminating humanity), it also risks an unknown outcome. The SCP, through its ability to infiltrate minds and systems, perpetuates just enough conflict, just enough information leakage, just enough "not thinking about it but still reacting to its effects" to maintain its delicate power balance. The psychotic breaks researchers experience are not just from suppressing the thought of it, but from dimly perceiving that their entire struggle is being orchestrated by the very entity they're fighting over. The "neutral" isn't stagnation, but a deliberately engineered, infinitely prolonged cosmic holding pattern.
