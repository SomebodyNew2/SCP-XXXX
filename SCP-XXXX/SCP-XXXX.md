#SCP-XXXX

TO CLARIFY THIS IS NOT AN SCP, IT IS A MYTHOS—A TALE.


1. Object Class: Keter Apollyon (ACTUALLY A THAUMIAL CLASS SCP BECAUSE IT LOCKS THE SCARLET KINGS DESCENT)
    
2. Chaos Insurgency
    

3. The Chaos Insurgency’s actual purpose ever since turning into a splinter organisation after the Foundation Civil war #Date-1924-1926) was to contain the Scarlet King, and they do this by killing people that know about XXXX, high command is extremely secretive due to this and not a lot of people actually know about XXXX and even less know about its purpose.
    

4. Written in a similar way to SCP-5000 with aspects of normal files mixed with tales.
    
5. Start the story with fragments of a deleted file or transmission
