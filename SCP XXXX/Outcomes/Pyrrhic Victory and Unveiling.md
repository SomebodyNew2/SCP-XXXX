[[Outcomes]]

1. The Foundation, in its efforts to contain the SCP and defeat the Chaos Insurgency, is forced to aggressively acknowledge and study the SCP to understand its properties. This direct, widespread attention, research, and documentation—especially within a global organization like the Foundation—causes the SCP to weaken catastrophically. The "chains" linking the Scarlet King's children and restraining the King himself become brittle, then snap. The Foundation wins the conventional war against the Insurgency, but their very act of victory, their pursuit of knowledge and control, inadvertently unleashes the Scarlet King in full. The final scene could be the Foundation celebrating their triumph, only for the skies to crack open and the whispers of the Scarlet King to echo across a suddenly doomed world. Their victory is the catalyst for the apocalypse they always sought to prevent.
