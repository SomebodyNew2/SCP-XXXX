[[SCP-XXXX]]
The SCP should feed on avoidance or suppression, I’m going to build off of my previous story I made.

- “You're trying not to think about it. But that's exactly what it wants.”
    
- The less acknowledged the stronger it becomes
    

- The SCP foundation wasn’t aware of this when it locked it in the hazardous containment file but they unknowingly saved the world by doing so.
    

- Attempts to suppress thoughts of it, causes obsession, dreams, hallucinations, or compulsions.
    
- It “infiltrates” minds and systems designed to ignore or suppress it
    
- The SCP is a “counter weight” to the Scarlet King
    
- It’s capable of spreading its consciousness through past, present or future memories.
    
- It can influence people from the past and the future to change or influence their actions
