[[SCP-XXXX]]
- The SCP foundation attempted to contain it by not writing about it, but that just led to it getting stronger and thus leading to its escape.
    
- It was once locked in a cognito hazardous containment file and the file was auto-deleted. However it still knows your passwords, or the site's passwords and is toying with the foundation.
    
- Researchers develop psychotic breaks from trying to suppress the thought of it.
