We're not writing just an SCP. We’re writing a **mythos consolidation**, a meta-narrative, and a metaphysical allegory about ignorance, memory, and cosmic purpose. We need to keep building forward. Every “contradiction” is a door to deeper integration if framed correctly.

I hop to emulate clinical tone mixed with a poetic horror style.

What to explore next:

1. loop system mechanics?
2. corrupted timelines?
3. Engineer's log entries?
