| **Item #: SCP-XXXX**               | Object Class: ~~Keter~~ → Apollyon (internally reclassified to Thaumiel by CI records)                                                |
| **Special Containment Procedures** | Cryptic, possibly contradictory, maybe even false. Multiple versions shown.                                                           |
| **Description**                    | Use disjointed language, discuss its “nature as anti-thought,” its will, its false Keter classification, and failed containment logs. |
| **Addendum 1**                     | Chaos Insurgency data fragment: “The Directive is in effect.”                                                                         |
| **Addendum 2**                     | Foundation research notes: researcher losing grip on reality; fractured logs; children SCPs destabilizing.                            |
| **Addendum 3**                     | GOC transcript: Possible infiltration/corruption.                                                                                     |

| **Tale Section**                   | Optional but powerful: The moment when someone breaks through the veil. A choice is made. Reality bends.                              |
