### 1. **Clarify the Whisper’s POV**

The “whisper”/narrator voice seems to intrude at various points, but it's unclear **who or what** is speaking/thinking in lines like:

> “Again—it’ll never stop will it?”  
> “Why’s he trailing off again? Idiotic, much.”  
> “All these hidden lies—deceit running thin.”

Is this:

- Roger’s internal monologue?
    
- The will of SCP-XXXX expressing itself?
    
- A third-party narrator or loop-aware observer?
    

📌 **Recommendation**: Assign this whisper a clearer identity or suggest its origin through implication. For example, give Roger internal thoughts in _italics_, but use a different voice style (long dashes, all lowercase, etc.) for the whisper.

### 2. **Leverage the “Whisper” as Structural Motif**

Since your tale begins with:

> “It begins with a whisper—a poisonous flicker on the screen…”

Make that motif **recurrent**. Let the whisper repeat phrases, shift tone, or glitch. Examples:

- **Echoes**:
    
    > “Again—it’ll never stop, will it?”  
    > _Again—it will never stop… will it?_  
    > AGAIN. It stops. But only for now.
    
- **Corrupted dialogue logs**:
    
    > [DATA FRAGMENT CORRUPTED]  
    > "The whi…isper is g—tting closer"

### 3. **Insert One Clear ‘Anomalous’ Event**

Currently, the flickering screen, altered memory, and badge blur are excellent mood-setters, but consider adding **one moment of undeniable impossibility**, even if brief.

Suggestions:

- A character says something that hasn’t happened yet (loop bleed).
    
- A monitor shows **Roger's own current conversation** as if pre-recorded.
    
- A file auto-deletes mid-sentence after being mentioned.
    

This can serve as a **hook** for readers who need a clear anomaly to latch onto.

### 4. **Refine the Ending Beat**

The closing lines are haunting:

> “Again this whisper screams into my ear.”

But they could hit harder if tied back to a concept like the **Unwritten Directive** or the chain’s function.

📌 **Suggestion**:  
Let the final line hint at inevitable recursion:

> “Again… the whisper screams. But this time, I think I remember the scream.”

Or tie it into loop awareness:

> “Again—the whisper screams. Again, the door clangs. Again, I forget what it means to disobey.”
