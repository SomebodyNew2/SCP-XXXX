[[SCP-XXXX]]
It begins with a whisper—a poisonous flicker on the screen—as if the very idea is being restrained, like a dandelion stuck in a breathless wind, no hope in sight. 

“Where is it?!” A researcher cries, tumbling out in confusion, “Where has it gone?—” A state of incredulity and panic sets off in the room. A visible flicker of light manifests, as if containing something dangerous—a soft stutter in the stream of data, struck by a collective fever. More screens join in, their glitches multiplying exponentially, until finally, one remains. The sound of paper rustling is as evident as ever, a few words of discomfort still ringing through the air; are they beginning to realise what’s happened, or are they choosing to ignore it?

“Are you alright Roger?”

Pandemonium evaporates instantly. The frantic rustling of papers falls silent, the air itself exhaling and taking away the remnants of disorder, as though someone had hit a reset button on reality. 

"Sorry, what were you talking about again, Reynolds?" Roger mumbles, his words heavy, his eyes fuzzy with a disoriented haze. As if he'd just blinked back into reality and the conversation had already slipped away.

Again—it’ll never stop will it?

Reynolds, a thin man with perpetually furrowed brows, adjusts his glasses and looks at Roger with a mix of concern and suspicion. "I was asking about the anomaly in Sector 7, the data spike. It just... vanished." He gestures vaguely at the still-flickering screen, which now displays only a bland, looping graphic of a swirling blue vortex. "You were looking right at it, Roger. You even said—"

Why’s he trailing off again? Idiotic, much.

Roger scratches his head, a slow, confused motion. "Data spike? …Sector 7? I don't... I don't remember anything like that." He glances at the screen, then back at Reynolds, a flicker of unease in his eyes. They're acting like nothing happened. But I know better.

Just then, a security guard walks past the large, glass partition of the office. He's a tall, bulky figure, his uniform a dull grey. But something's off. His ID badge, usually clearly visible, is blurred, almost like a smudge of grey. Then, as he blinks, the blur vanishes, and the badge is perfectly clear for a moment, before blurring again as he continues his stride. And his gait, normally a steady, rhythmic stride, is slightly uneven, a jerky, almost robotic movement. He's changed. They all have.

"Did you see that?" Reynolds whispers, his eyes wide. "His badge... it's..."

This time it’s quite the shift.

The room was like a quiet meadow entrenched in a windmill of sounds, a dandelion marking its appearance in the centre—wind devoid of any emotion, and as such nothing could be swayed. The sound of a door clangs, the sound echoing sharply in the already humming space. The gentle windmill of sounds starts to churn, the individual hums overlapping and clashing, building into a chaotic buzz that vibrates in the air. It's like the room itself is holding its breath, the energy tightening around the computer in the middle.

All these hidden lies—deceit running thin. How much longer will it take to break this unending cycle? Again—the central computer glows ominously—how… Unfortunate… Again this whisper screams into my ear.
