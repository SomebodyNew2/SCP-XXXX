### → As a Prologue

Use this as the _opening shot_ of the mythos. Frame it as the last recoverable log before SCP-XXXX reactivates or resets reality. Attach it to a corrupted data cluster labelled `[ARCHIVAL TIER: 0]` or `[UNWRITTEN DIRECTIVE LOG: -1]`.

### → As a Tale Fragment Inside the File

Embed this tale in the SCP-XXXX entry itself as Addendum A or [FILE RETRIEVED FROM SECTOR 7 INCIDENT].

### → As the First “Loop Cycle” Record

Reveal in a future addendum that this event has happened before. Maybe the **next log** repeats the scene with tiny changes—Roger’s name is different, or the anomaly occurs in Sector 6 instead. This plants your time-loop seed early.
