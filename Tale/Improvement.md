#Tale [[The Unwritten Directive]]

This one sentence:

> _"The air itself exhaling and taking away the remnants of disorder, as though someone had hit a reset button on reality."_

This is pure SCP-XXXX in action.

I should consider building a running theme of **“reality exhalations”** or **“conceptual resets.”** Each time it occurs, more of the chain weakens—or strengthens. This could be the unique mechanic: **the SCP doesn't erase memories... it resets the reality frame that contains them.**
