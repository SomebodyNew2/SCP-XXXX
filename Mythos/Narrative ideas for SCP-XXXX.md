| -2      | _Memory_          | An infohazard that erases itself     | Referenced in the Tale: anti-memetic effects |

| SCP-231      | Explicitly connect one child’s pain to the weakening of SCP-XXXX.                                                                       |
| SCP-999      | Is being drawn toward SCP-XXXX without understanding why—joy confronting a memory it cannot comprehend.                                 |
| SCP-682      | Begins to speak in ritualistic phrases. Calls out “the false chain.” Could be planning to break SCP-XXXX.                               |
| SCP-055      | Optional twist: SCP-055 was **once** SCP-XXXX before the loop reset. A past version of the same concept.                                |
| SCP-5000     | The future loop is **one where SCP-XXXX was overwritten or misunderstood**—thus causing the chaos. The Engineer is the last loopwalker. |
| Scarlet King | Portray him as not “coming,” but **waiting**—for us to **do it to ourselves**. The King’s descent is passive—he’s entropy incarnate.    |
