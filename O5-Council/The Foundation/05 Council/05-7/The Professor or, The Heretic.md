#05-7
Defected with [[The Keeper or, The Warden]] and [[The Gangster]]. Former position of professor at a major university and a trained psychologist and even held this position whilst being apart of the 05 council. They are the primary instigator of the #Foundation-Civil-War 

Co-created the first iteration of the Chaos insurgency with [[The Gangster]] and is likely the reason the [[Chaos Insurgency/Chaos Insurgency]] is called the Chaos Insurgency.

Because they deflected during the foundation civil war it would mean that this is the same timeline as [[The Man With The Infinity Gun]].
